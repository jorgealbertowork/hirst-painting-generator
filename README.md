# Hirst Painting Generator

Inspired on the series of paintings "Spots", by Damien Hirst, this simple program generates an image on screen using the Colorgram.py (to generate a RGB color palette) and the Turtle Graphics libraries (to draw the image).

**Dependencies:** 
- Colorgram.py
- Turtle Graphics

***This was the final exercise of the day 18 of the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp", on Udemy.***
